# Aesthetic BOT

Aesthetic BOT (aesthetic-bot) started development after looking at bots for sale on the market, but they have problems due to their complexity; our mission is to develop a basic and still effective Discord bot. More specifically, the goal is to allow for the intergration of addons that allow for a larger range of features. All in the name of free, open source, transparency, and collaboration. For the occasion, we even created a license.
